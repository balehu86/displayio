# displayio introduction
GUI written in MicroPythonã€‚  
now widget only support label and button, and device only support st7789  
but it is easy to extern other driver and widget

The usage is  same as [Beeware Toga](https://github.com/beeware/toga.git) .  
And it is CSS like too.  

Now, it provides for container box (flex, free, grid and scroll).    

Input device support esp32 TouchPad, physical button and encoder. input device provide a useful func to en able you map a default event output to any other event.  

the display is dynamical, so show_fps is not correct.
you can specify the fps in init of display.

# create your own widget
1. you need to import the base widget file  
   `import displayio.widget.widget`
2. rewrite the func called `widget.draw`, you can find the example in label.py or button.py
3. the `widget.draw` is aim to draw `widget._bitmap` and wait for render system to blit it to screen or gloable `root._bitmap`
